D3.js is a great JavaScript library that allows you to create custom data visualizations and Polymer.js is promising to build a better web for tomorrow with its philosophy 'Everything is an Element' so I'm excited to play with it.

I would love to see a dashboard defined by HTML element and I love D3 so I'm learning on my way to see how can they be tight together.

This repository is experimental and visualize a simple bar chart like the one described by Mike Bostock. http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/2/ using in SVG with polymer and d3 functions.

<h1>Setup</h1>

Run git clone https://github.com/arlejeun/d3-polymer.git <br>
cd d3-polymer-test <br>
Run npm install && bower install <br>
You can now preview the application by running grunt serve.<br>
